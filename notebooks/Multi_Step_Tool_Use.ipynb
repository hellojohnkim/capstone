Serafeim, George, and Jody Grewal.\\xa0“ESG Metrics: Reshaping Capitalism?” Har\\xad\\nvard Business School Technical Note 116-037, March 2016.\\nS\\nustainability in business refers to the integration \\nof social and environmental considerations, such \\nas climate change and income inequality, into \\nbusiness strategy and practices. Defined in this \\nway, sustainability is a subject of growing interest to inves\\xad\\ntors and companies alike, who are asking themselves: Is this \\nbusiness approach finance-worthy—that is, capable of earn\\xad\\ning high enough rates of return to continue to attract capital \\nfrom private investors? And if so, how can investors (and \\nthe companies themselves) evaluate corporate sustainability \\nprograms and investments?\\nTo help provide answers to such questions, investors are \\nincreasingly turning to a myriad of environmental, social, \\nand governance (ESG) data that have recently become avail\\xad\\nable. This profusion of new data has been facilitated by the \\ndramatic growth in the number of public companies report\\xad\\ning ESG information, from fewer than 20 in the early 1990s \\nto 8,500 by 2014.1 Moreover, by the beginning of 2016, \\nover 1,400 institutional investors with some $60 trillion in \\nassets under management had signed the UN Principles for \\nResponsible Investment (PRI), a document that—at least \\nin theory—commits its signers to consider corporate ESG \\nperformance and data when allocating capital.\\xa0\\nUntil very recently, however, there has been considerable \\ndoubt, especially among mainstream investors, that compa\\xad\\nnies with high ESG “scores” could succeed in producing \\ncompetitive returns for their shareholders. Studies of the last \\nthree decades of the 20th century have reported that what was \\nthen known as Socially Responsible Investing (or SRI)—an \\ninvestment approach that worked mainly by screening out \\nthe companies with the lowest ESG scores or entire industries \\nsuch as tobacco and alcohol—produced shareholder returns \\nthat were often below market averages. And this finding has \\nin turn contributed to the widespread perception that corpo\\xad\\nrate efforts to address environmental and social issues end up \\nreducing shareholder value. \\nBut according to the findings of a large and growing body \\nof studies conducted in the past ten years, companies with \\nabove-average ESG scores have actually outperformed their \\ncompetitors, both in terms of standard measures of operat\\xad\\ning performance and stock market returns. Of course, high \\nESG scores are not always associated with high returns, and \\nmany studies have shown that the superior performance of \\nESG-conscious companies tends to be concentrated in certain \\nindustries with certain kinds of customers and employees. \\nMoreover, such studies always come with a warning to \\nreaders against confusing association with a causal relation\\xad\\nship between high ESG scores and above-market shareholder \\nreturns.\\nBut even so, a large and growing number of studies—\\nsome of which we discuss below—have developed and tested \\nresearch designs that limit the possibility that their findings \\nare driven by correlated (or “omitted”) variables, or by “reverse \\ncausality.” In the pages that follow, we attempt to dispel, \\nalong with five other common myths about ESG invest\\xad\\ning, the widespread misconception that corporate efforts to \\naddress environmental and social issues always require share\\xad\\nholders to settle for lower long-run profitability and value. At \\nthe same time, we consider the major challenges that remain \\nin strengthening ESG integration in mainstream investment \\nmanagement and suggest ways of responding to them.\\nMyth Number 1: The net financial effect of corporate efforts to \\naddress environmental and social issues is the reduction of corpo\\xad\\nrate returns on operating capital and, along with them, long-run \\nshareholder value; and so, although ESG makes investors feel \\ngood, it effectively asks them to accept lower returns on investment.\\nReality: One of the most common misconceptions about \\ncorporate efforts to address environmental and social issues \\nis that they constitute mainly a cost to the business—a cost \\nthat, while meeting the demands of certain corporate stake\\xad\\nholders, effectively ends up reducing shareholder value. To be \\nsure, addressing social or environmental issues could prove \\nvery costly for some companies. For example, companies that \\nattempt to address social inequality by dramatically raising \\nwages for low-skilled workers could quickly find themselves \\nunable to compete, and even go out of business. But the possi\\xad\\nbility now being explored by a growing number of companies \\nis whether such wage increases can prove to be a cost-effective \\nway of improving employee morale and productivity—and, \\nmore generally, whether all kinds of corporate investments in \\nrelationships with non-investor stakeholders such as suppliers \\nby Sakis Kotsantonis, KKS Advisors, Chris Pinney, High Meadows Institute, and \\nGeorge Serafeim, Harvard Business School\\n', metadata={'source': '../data/ESG Integration in Investment Management- Myths and Realities.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/ESG Integration in Investment Management- Myths and Realities.pdf', 'page': 1, 'total_pages': 9, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creationDate': \"D:20160701064529-04'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20160701135535-04'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

More specifically, the valua\\xad\\ntions of companies with above-average ESG performance are \\nshown to reflect higher expected growth and a lower cost of \\ncapital. 3 In addition, such companies tend to trade at higher \\nvaluation multiples in equity markets and to have lower credit \\ndefault swap spreads.\\nBut if the research and evidence suggest significant \\nbenefits from ESG integration, why does the myth of sustain\\xad\\nability as a cost or low-return investment persist? Part of the \\nanswer has to do with the fact that many mainstream inves\\xad\\ntors and SRI funds still continue to employ exclusionary \\nscreens as their ESG integration tool. This set of investment \\npractices is unable to capture the value added by sustainability \\ninitiatives in certain companies, and as a result these funds \\nhave not yet produced the returns one would expect. But \\neven more important in explaining the popular perception \\nof sustainability as a negative-NPV project is the clear reality \\nthat, as demonstrated by recent research, only a relatively \\nsmall subset of the ESG data is what might be described as \\n“material” and hence “value-relevant” for each industry. And \\nthis subset differs from industry to industry.\\nThis reality is the main premise underlying the efforts of \\nthe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board to identify \\n“material” ESG issues for nearly 80 different industries and \\npropose reporting standards for each.4 For example, accord\\xad\\ning to the SASB, managing environmental impact is a very \\nimportant element of business strategy for companies in \\nthe fossil fuel and transportation industries. But managing \\nenvironmental impact is relatively unimportant (or “immate\\xad\\nrial”) for financial institutions and healthcare companies, \\nwhere other ESG concerns, such as fair marketing and adver\\xad\\ntising of products, tend to be very important.\\nIn a study published in the past year, the authors (includ\\xad\\ning one of the present writers) began by accepting, for each \\nindustry,5 the SASB’s distinction between “material” and, by \\nimplication, “immaterial” ESG issues. Then, for a sample of \\nmore than 2,000 U.S. companies between 1993 and 2013, \\nthe authors assessed the levels of corporate performance with \\nregard to each of their corresponding material and immaterial \\nESG issues. And by quantifying corporate efforts to manage \\nboth their material and immaterial exposures, the authors \\nwere able to construct two sets of rankings: one index that \\nranked companies based on their investments in addressing \\nmaterial issues and a second that ranked companies based on \\ntheir investments in issues deemed to be immaterial.\\nWhat the authors found was that companies making \\nmajor investments in material ESG issues experienced both \\nhigher growth in profit margins and higher risk-adjusted \\nand governments as well as employees can succeed in leverag\\xad\\ning capabilities and creating win-win situations. Though even \\nwhile acknowledging the possibility of such positive-NPV \\ninvestments in their stakeholders, corporate managers must \\nalso know when to stop investing in such efforts, in order to \\nbe able to produce economically attractive returns.\\nWith the aim of providing answers to such questions, a \\nsignificant amount of research has been carried out in recent \\nyears to better understand the economic effects of integrating \\nESG issues into corporate financial decision-making, both \\nfrom a company and an investor perspective. The general \\nthrust of this research is that, at least for some kinds of \\ncompanies in some industries, such stakeholder investment \\ncan prove to be a source of competitive advantage and value \\nthat is increasingly being recognized by investors.\\nIn one notable example of such research, a recent report \\nby Calvert Investments (written with one of the authors of \\nthis article) provides a framework to help companies and their \\ninvestors understand the ways in which corporate social and \\nenvironmental activities can and have led to value creation.2 \\nFor example, companies often cite the cost savings achieved \\nby reducing waste and improving energy efficiency as benefits \\nof environmental initiatives. And to the extent that investors \\nview a company’s efficient use of natural capital resources as \\na reliable proxy for management’s efficiency in using other \\nresources, particularly investor capital, such savings can trans\\xad\\nlate into a significant increase in corporate values. Another \\nfrequently mentioned benefit of sustainable business practices \\nis more effective risk management, which in turn can help \\nprotect a company’s reputation and brand value. When inves\\xad\\ntors are impressed by such practices, they are likely to require \\nlower returns on capital (which has the effect of reducing the \\ncompany’s “cost of capital”) and assign higher P/E multiples \\nto the firm’s current earnings or cash flow. Through their \\neffects on corporate reputation and brand values, sustainabil\\xad\\nity practices can also increase companies’ long-run values by \\nhelping them attract a more talented and engaged workforce, \\nas well as more satisfied and loyal customers. Finally, another \\ngoal of some corporate sustainability programs are increases \\nin revenue from satisfying new customer needs and serving \\npreviously underserved parts of the population. And as the \\nCalvert report notes, recent academic studies have provided \\nsupporting evidence for each of these different ways that \\nsustainability initiatives can increase corporate cash flow or \\nshareholder value.\\nAlong with this evidence of the effects of sustainability \\non corporate operating performance, the report also presents \\nnew research findings that attest to the market’s recognition \\n', metadata={'source': '../data/ESG Integration in Investment Management- Myths and Realities.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/ESG Integration in Investment Management- Myths and Realities.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 9, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creationDate': \"D:20160701064529-04'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20160701135535-04'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

But such a practice, \\nwhich accounts for an estimated $14.4 trillion of AUM, \\nrepresents a relatively minimal level of integration of ESG \\nfactors into investment decision-making. \\nThe second most common sustainable investing strat\\xad\\negy involves a combination of ESG integration—which is \\nestimated to account for some $12.9 trillion of AUM—\\nand corporate engagement, or shareholder action, with an \\nestimated $7 trillion devoted to it. But the lion’s share of \\nsuch investing today is taking place in Europe rather than \\nthe U.S. According to the U.S. Forum for Sustainable and \\nResponsible Investment, the total assets in the U.S. that \\nare managed with ESG factors explicitly incorporated into \\ninvestment analysis and decision-making are valued at $6.2 \\ntrillion, which represents only 16% of total AUM in the \\nU.S.7 Most of those AUM are still managed using negative \\nscreening.\\nTo better understand the challenges involved in deepen\\xad\\ning ESG integration, a 2015 report by the High Meadows \\nInstitute examined the ESG incorporation practices of the \\nlargest (in terms of AUM)7 25 global asset owners and asset \\nmanagers against the practices of major global companies. \\nThe research showed that there is a wide range of ESG \\nmetrics used, and most of those surveyed do not appear \\nto have the necessary governance and incentive systems to \\nensure meaningful integration of ESG factors in investment \\nstrategy and valuation models across asset classes.\\nThus, while there is growing interest in ESG by investors \\nand expanding niche markets for “sustainable” investment \\nproducts, we are still a long way from seeing ESG integrated \\ninto the models that drive most mainstream investment \\ndecision-making. \\nMyth Number 3: Companies have little if any ability to influ\\xad\\nence the kinds of investors who buy their company’s shares. And \\nbecause the main focus of the vast majority of investors is near-\\nterm reported earnings, with holding periods—and presumed \\ntime horizons—ranging from three months to a year, corpo\\xad\\nrate managers are often forced by market pressures to sacrifice \\nsustainability goals to meet quarterly earnings targets. \\nReality: Capital markets are made up of an extraordi\\xad\\nnary variety of investors; and although most have a clear \\npreference for companies that aim to maximize value—at \\nleast over the longer run—such investors exhibit a wide \\nrange of holding periods and time horizons. What’s more, \\nas has been demonstrated by a growing body of research, \\ndifferent management practices tend to attract different \\ntypes of investors, which in turn suggests that corporate \\nmanagers have some ability to shape their investor base \\n\\nstock returns than otherwise comparable companies. At \\nthe same time, and in pointed contrast, those companies \\nthat made significant investments in ESG issues the SASB \\ndeemed to be immaterial were associated with average or, in \\nsome cases, even inferior performance.\\nThe message here, then, is the importance of distin\\xad\\nguishing corporate initiatives and investments designed to \\nmanage material, business-related ESG exposures—those \\nwith large potential effects on the long-run value of the \\nfirm—from efforts to deal with relatively unimportant, \\nthough perhaps socially popular, ESG issues. The research \\nwe have suggests that there is a significant payoff to the \\nfirst, in terms of increases in profits as well as stock returns, \\nwhile the expected returns for investing in concerns that \\nare largely peripheral to the business are neutral to negative.\\nMyth Number 2: ESG is well on its way to being integrated \\ninto mainstream investment management and capital markets \\nwith over $60 trillion in assets now subscribed to the Principles \\nfor Responsible Investment established by the UN (UNPRI).\\nReality: While the growing number of signatories to the \\nUNPRI is an encouraging step forward, it is a misleading \\nindicator of the actual level of ESG integration in capital \\nmarkets. The reality is that PRI signatories commit only to \\nbehaving in accordance with a set of principles for responsible \\ninvestment, a commitment that falls well short of integrating \\nESG considerations into all their investment decisions.\\nA more accurate picture of what is happening with ESG \\nintegration can be found in the annual report provided by \\nthe Global Sustainable Investment Alliance. According to \\nthe GSIA report, the estimated size of the global sustain\\xad\\nable investment market at the start of 2014 was around \\n$21.4 trillion, and thus only about a third of the $60 trillion \\nmanaged by UNPRI signatories.6 The difference between \\nthe Assets Under Management (AUM) of UNPRI signa\\xad\\ntories and the actual sustainable investment market can be \\naccounted for by the facts that (1) not all signatories either \\ncomply fully with the principles or are at the same stage of \\ndevelopment of their ESG integration process, and (2) signa\\xad\\ntories are not obliged to apply ESG integration practices to \\ntheir total AUM. \\nWhen we drill down further, we discover that of all the \\ndifferent sustainable investing strategies, by far the most \\ncommon globally is the practice of “negative screening.” \\nNegative screening involves eliminating from the invest\\xad\\nment universe companies or countries that do not comply \\nwith certain standards or international treaties, such as \\nthe Fundamental Conventions of the International Labor \\nOrganization (ILO).

See http://www.sseinitiative.org/engagement/esg-guidance/.\\nthere is a clear potential to change a company’s shareholder \\nbase in ways that end up contributing to increases in long-run \\nprofitability and value. By giving management the confidence \\nto resist excessive pressure for short-term performance, the \\npresence of supportive long-term holders can encourage \\ntop management both to make commitments to long-run \\nsustainability goals, and, even if it means missing a quarterly \\nearnings target, to make good on those commitments. One \\nexample of such encouragement from markets came on the \\nday (April 13, 2015) Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris \\nannounced the company’s commitment to the “third genera\\xad\\ntion” of its 10-year sustainability goals, a day when Dow’s \\nstock price outperformed its competitors’ by some 3.5%, an \\nunambiguous sign of some investors’ enthusiasm about the \\nfirm’s long-run prospects. \\nMyth Number 4: It is nearly impossible to do good fundamental \\nanalysis taking into account ESG data because the data infra\\xad\\nstructure is really lacking.\\nReality: Although the argument that ESG data is still not \\nat the same level as financial data holds true, there has been \\ntremendous progress during the last few years in increasing \\nthe availability and quality of data. \\nCompanies are increasingly reporting ESG data. While \\nthere were fewer than 20 companies producing reports \\nwith ESG information in the early 1990s, there has been \\nan exponential increase to nearly 8,400 companies in 2014. \\nInvestor interest in ESG data has also been growing at a fast \\npace. Between November 2010 and April 2011, capital market \\nparticipants have tried to access ESG metrics 44 million times \\nusing their Bloomberg terminals.12\\nOther capital market players have also played important \\nroles in the move toward better ESG reporting. The sustain\\xad\\nable stock exchanges initiative was created to facilitate the \\ndialogue among stock exchanges, investors, regulators, and \\ncompanies and, in so doing, to increase corporate trans\\xad\\nparency. Stock exchanges are in a unique position to help \\nimprove ESG data availability and quality by including listing \\nrequirements related to ESG reporting and providing appro\\xad\\npriate guidance and training. As of 2016, 15 stock exchanges \\nhad produced ESG reporting guidance for listed companies, \\nand 23 had committed to producing guidance—while 41 \\nhad yet to do either.13\\nSeveral organizations have been instrumental in increas\\xad\\ning the availability of ESG data. For example, the Global \\nin ways that are consistent with the strategy of the organi\\xad\\nzation.\\nMuch of this research uses a method of classifying U.S. \\ninstitutional investors into one of three categories that was \\ndeveloped by Wharton accounting Professor Brian Bushee. \\nThe three categories are as follows: (1) “transients”—those \\ninvestors who hold lots of stocks with high turnover and \\nshort holding periods; (2) “quasi-indexers”—those holding \\nlots of stocks with little turnover and long holding periods; \\nand (3) “dedicated holders”—those holding relatively few \\nstocks for long periods of time.9 In a study published a \\nyear ago in this journal, one of us examined the effect of \\nU.S. companies’ use of integrated reporting on their share\\xad\\nholder base.10 The findings of the study showed not only \\nthat companies that adopt more integrated reporting see \\nincreases in their ratios of dedicated holders to transients, \\nbut also that investor activism on sustainability issues and \\nthe presence of a sustainability crisis have led companies to \\npractice more integrated reporting, thereby helping them \\nattract more long-term investors.\\nTo see these findings in action, consider the case of the \\nbiotech firm called Shire. Shire managed to change its investor \\nbase over time by using top leadership commitment to make \\nsustainability issues a major strategic focus of the organization, \\nand to use integrated reporting as a way to communicate these \\nefforts. The change in Shire’s shareholder base was detected by \\ncomparing the change in the ratio of the company’s dedicated \\nholders to its transient investors during the five-year period \\nfrom 2006 through 2011. In 2006, Shire’s dedicated holders \\nwere outnumbered almost four to one by transients. By the \\nend of 2011, and some four years after Shire had begun to \\nimplement its sustainability-centered strategy, the company’s \\ndedicated holders actually outnumbered its transients, which \\nis highly unusual for a public company.11 By 2011, investment \\nmanagers such as Domini Social Investments, Norges Bank \\nInvestment Management, Scottish Widows, and Aviva Inves\\xad\\ntors—all well known for incorporating ESG considerations \\ninto their decision-making—were all holding significant \\npositions in Shire’s stock, which most of them hold to this \\nday. In sharp contrast, the institutional shareholders of Shire’s \\ncompetitors, while less dominated by short-term momentum \\ntypes than Shire’s investors in 2006, actually became more \\nshort-term oriented over this same five-year period.\\nIn sum, the success of companies that practice integrated \\nreporting in attracting longer-term shareholders suggests that \\n', metadata={'source': '../data/ESG Integration in Investment Management- Myths and Realities.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/ESG Integration in Investment Management- Myths and Realities.pdf', 'page': 4, 'total_pages': 9, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS6 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1', 'creationDate': \"D:20160701064529-04'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20160701135535-04'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

Eccles and George Serafeim, “The Performance Frontier,” Harvard \\nBusiness Review, 2013.\\nWhile there has been a considerable increase in the \\nvolume of ESG data, the challenge for investors remains \\nto identify those ESG factors that are material to financial \\nperformance and a framework for corporate reporting and \\ncommunication with investors around these factors. As \\nreported in the 2015 HMI study cited earlier, asset owners, \\nasset managers and companies all tend to use different \\nframework and metrics, which further complicates the task \\nof ESG integration. Initiatives like SASB are important steps \\nforward in identifying which ESG factors are material by \\nindustry. We are also seeing industry-driven initiatives, such \\nas Project Delphi and HMI’s ESG Path to Value Industry \\nForum, that are designed to create practical approaches to \\nhelp mainstream investment analysts and portfolio managers \\nacross asset classes identify material ESG factors and trans\\xad\\nlate them into data that can be used in their valuation models \\nand investment strategies. \\nIn sum, both the availability and quality of data are \\nincreasing at a fast pace. And although ESG data are still \\nnot as rigorous as financial data, one needs to remember the \\ntime and effort it took for financial data to reach its current \\nlevel. The profession of accounting was recognized in 1896, \\nwhen the title of “certified public accountant” was first used, \\nand it took several decades for financial data to reach the \\ncurrent level of rigor.\\nMyth Number 5: ESG is only about managing risk and reduc\\xad\\ning costs.\\xa0 \\nReality: Many consider ESG integration as a tool to \\nprotect reputation, manage risk, and maybe decrease costs \\nby introducing efficiencies. The truth is that if companies \\napproach ESG integration only from a risk management \\nperspective, they may well find themselves underperform\\xad\\ning their peers.\\nAs discussed in an article called “The Performance \\nFrontier,” in the absence of major innovation, the financial \\nperformance of companies may well decline even as their \\nESG performance improves.16 ESG integration can be a \\nway to achieve growth in revenue while both managing risk \\nand improving operational efficiency. Take the case of Dow \\nChemical, which has shifted from a risk management stance \\non sustainability to leveraging technology and innovation \\nto provide new products and solutions. Dow’s management \\nidentified opportunity areas that relate to the company’s key \\ncapabilities that have resulted in potential markets whose \\nworth is estimated at some $320 billion. Several of the \\ncompany’s recent innovations were the output of sustainabil\\xad\\nity-driven strategic planning. For example, Dow’s membrane \\ntechnologies are now positioned to reduce the cost of water \\nReporting Initiative (GRI), which was the first organization \\nto provide guidance on disclosure of ESG metrics, has now \\nseen over 7,000 organizations voluntarily adopt those guide\\xad\\nlines. As mentioned earlier, the Sustainability Accounting \\nBoard has been developing and disseminating industry-\\nspecific sustainability accounting standards that are designed \\nto help publicly listed corporations disclose material factors \\nin compliance with Securities and Exchange Commis\\xad\\nsion (SEC) requirements. Although SASB has a particular \\nfocus on the U.S. market, the topics for which the SASB \\nsets standards are industry-specific, not region-specific, and \\ntherefore apply to most companies and investors in global \\nmarkets. And the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) has \\nencouraged, and achieved considerable success in persuad\\xad\\ning, companies and cities across the world’s largest economies \\nto measure and disclose environmental information.\\n\\t At the same time, the number of mainstream and \\nspecialized data providers that have seized the opportunity \\nprovided by a growing ESG market and ESG corporate \\nreporting has also increased rapidly. One survey has reported \\nfinding that more than 80 ESG rankings and ratings have \\nbeen developed in the last decade alone.14 Bloomberg \\ncollects ESG data from published company material and \\nintegrates the data into the Equities and Bloomberg Intel\\xad\\nligence platforms. Currently Bloomberg covers more than \\n11,300 companies with ESG data in 69 countries. The \\nnumber of customers using ESG data on Bloomberg termi\\xad\\nnals has increased from 1,545 in 2009 to over 12,000 in \\n2015.15 Thomson Reuters, through its ESG research platform, \\nprovides a database containing information on over 5,000 \\nglobal companies and over 400 metrics.\\nMany major data providers are also involved in dissem\\xad\\ninating ESG information. For example, in 2015 MSCI \\nprovided coverage on 6,000 companies on the equities \\nside and 9,000 issuers and 350,000 securities on the fixed \\nincome side.

Giving particular weight to this view in the \\nU.S., a 2008 Employee Retirement Income Security Act \\n(ERISA) bulletin by the U.S. department of labor stated \\nthat fiduciaries should not make investment decisions that \\ntake into account “any factor outside the economic interest \\nof the plan.”\\nOver the last 15 years, however, research has shown that \\nmany ESG factors like environmental practices can have a \\ndirect or indirect material impact on the financial perfor\\xad\\nmance of companies and should be considered by investment \\nmanagers. These factors can no longer be dismissed as simply \\nsocial or ethical issues. The challenge for investment manag\\xad\\ners is to identify and take account of the relevant ESG factors \\nfor the industries and companies they are investing in. While \\nthis may be complicated by the lack of industry standards \\nto guide ESG reporting and the increasingly “noisy” ESG \\nreporting environment, this is a task they must now take on \\nif they are truly to act in the fiduciary interest of the benefi\\xad\\nciaries they serve.\\nThe importance of developing such standards has also \\nbeen increasingly recognized by policymakers and multi-\\nstakeholder initiatives, which are now working to promote \\ndesalination and reuse in the transportation and infrastruc\\xad\\nture industries by as much as 35%.\\nAnother example of how sustainability has created \\nmarket opportunities is GE’s Ecomagination initiative. \\nDuring the last decade, GE’s R&D investment of some \\n$17 billion has generated some $232 billion of revenue, \\nwhile resulting in a 12% reduction in the company’s own \\nGHG emissions and a 17% reduction in its use of freshwa\\xad\\nter. In yet another case, Unilever implemented an analytics \\nplatform that enables line-of-business managers to track all \\nthe complex elements related to supply chain efficiency and \\nenvironmental impact and to take corrective actions. By \\naggregating the data and making it easier to analyze, Unile\\xad\\nver has reduced the time devoted to tracking raw materials \\nby 80%.\\nMyth Number 6:\\xa0\\xa0Consideration of ESG factors in investment \\nportfolio construction is contrary to fiduciary duty.\\nReality: A common concern expressed by investment \\nmanagers, particularly in the U.S., is the possibility that \\nintegrating ESG factors into their valuation models could \\nbe seen as a failure to uphold their fiduciary duty and the \\n“prudent investor” rule.\\xa0 Their reasoning is that fiduciaries, \\nunder their duty of loyalty to protect the financial interest of \\ntheir beneficiaries, must consider only traditional economic \\nfactors in their valuation models and therefore must exclude \\nTable 1 \\t\\nMyth\\nReality\\n1.

Pástor and Stam-\\nbaugh (2003) added to the list of established\\nrisk premia in their quantitative study entitled\\n“Liquidity Risk and Expected Stock Returns”, in\\nwhich they investigated the relationship between\\nasset pricing and market-wide liquidity, using\\ncross-sectional data relating the sensitivities of\\nreturns to ﬂuctuations in aggregate liquidity.6 In\\ndoing so, Pástor and Stambaugh establish liq-\\nuidity as a risk premium by demonstrating its\\nefﬁciency in predicting the probability distribu-\\ntion of returns for a particular asset.

These ﬁndings illustrate\\nthe impact that risk premia have on generating\\nalpha in equity investments, and also emphasize\\nthe fact that no single risk premia can exist as a\\nconstant through time. Furthermore, the results of\\nthis study indicate that additional risk premia may\\nexist outside of currently established risk premia.\\nIt is reasonable to assume that if risk premia pro-\\nvides insight into the probability distribution of\\nan asset, as per Fama and French’s (2014) con-\\nclusions, supported by Pástor and Stambaugh’s\\nresearch, and if additional risk premia exists that\\nis currently not identiﬁed as such, as per the\\nresearch of Bender et al. (2014), then it stands\\nto reason that one proof of the validity of ESG\\nrisk premium would evidence that said risk pre-\\nmia improves insight into an asset’s probability\\ndistribution. In a 2016 quantitative study entitled\\n“Skewness in Expected Macro Fundamentals and\\nthe Predictability of Equity Returns: Evidence\\nand Theory”, Ricardo Colacito, Eric Ghysels,\\nMeng Jinghen, and Wasin Shwasarit analyzed\\nwhether the GDP forecasts by professional fore-\\ncasters can have a material impact on the pre-\\ndictability of the equity return distribution.9 They\\nfound that the professional forecasting of macro\\nfundamentals provides cross-sectional data that is\\nuseful for predicting the probability distribution\\nof expected stock returns (see also: Polbennikov\\net al., 201610). This study demonstrates that\\nprofessional forecasting can provide meaningful\\ninsight into the expected returns of assets. In\\nthe same way, our study seeks to prove that the\\nprofessional forecasting displayed through ESG\\nresearch and cross-sectional ratings may yield\\nsigniﬁcant insight into the probability distribu-\\ntion of long-term risk-adjusted equity returns,\\nestablishing it as independent risk premia.\\n2.2\\nInvestor sentiment and risk premia\\nIn a 2016 quantitative case study entitled “Corre-\\nlated Beliefs, Returns, and Stock Market Volatil-\\nity”, Joel David and Ina Simonovska analyzed\\nwhether analysts’ correlated beliefs about the\\nﬁnancial performance of publicly traded com-\\npanies had an impact on the patterns of stock\\nreturns, apart from what was predictable through\\nfundamental analysis of those companies.11 Their\\nresearch more broadly investigated whether cor-\\nrelated beliefs can have an impact on the actual\\nequity return distribution of a forecasted stock.\\nDavid and Simonovska found that analysts’corre-\\nlated beliefs about the future path of a stock were\\n63% correlated to the actual path of that stock.\\nFurthermore, 44% of cross-sectional aggregate\\nstock market volatility was attributed to cor-\\nrelated beliefs alone. These conclusions were\\nafﬁrmed across multiple countries and regions,\\nand are signiﬁcant because they illustrate that\\ncorrelated beliefs on a ﬁrm’s future can have a\\ndirect impact on the actual future path of the stock.\\nResearchperformedbyWuetal.

(2016), in their\\nstudy, “ESG-Integration in Investment Manage-\\nment: Myths and Realities”, found that the data\\nprovided by ESG research and independent ESG\\nratings’ ﬁrms has evolved dramatically since the\\nearly 1990s and is now quite efﬁcient for pur-\\nposes of fundamental analysis.14 They attribute\\nthis increased efﬁciency to the populating effect\\nof ESG data since the early 1990s, which has\\nled to the creation of tremendous cross-sectional\\ninsight into the fundamentals of a company, and\\nthus the probability distribution of an asset. Dor-\\nﬂeitner et al. (2015) afﬁrm this populating effect\\nin their article entitled “An Empirical Compari-\\nson of Different ESG RatingApproaches”.15 This\\narticle analyzed the correlation between the ESG\\nratings and ﬁnancial performance of companies\\nworldwide. This study used data from three inde-\\npendent ESG ratings agencies, and found that\\nthough the ESG rating from a single service\\nprovider does not always have a clear correla-\\ntion to the ﬁnancial performance of the company,\\nthe triangulation of ESG rating data from multiple\\nESG rating agencies provides higher correlations\\nto ﬁnancial performance. These ﬁndings sug-\\ngest that the greater the ESG research coverage\\nfrom various ESG research and rating providers,\\nthe more effective and valid the ESG data is\\nat serving as cross-sectional data for ESG risk\\npremium insight. These ﬁndings further suggest\\nthat ESG is a risk premia factor that can inﬂu-\\nence the long-term expected return of an asset.\\nKotsantonis et al. (2016) also note that ESG fac-\\ntors are not currently well-integrated investment\\nportfolios, although companies with high ESG\\nscores offer better long-term stock returns due to\\nlower risks, lower cost of capital, superior operat-\\ning efﬁciency, and rapid expansion compared to\\ncompetitors.\\nThe correlation between ﬁnancial performance\\nand ESG ratings has been studied in many differ-\\nent lights.

However,\\nwhen the ESG portfolio was turned over, the six\\nlowest-performing stocks were replaced with the\\nsix stocks with the highest relative ESG rating\\nimprovement in industry-weighted ESG rating\\nscore for the quarter. This ESG improvement was\\nmeasured in relative terms, by quantifying the\\nincrease in ESG score over that quarter. Firms\\nthat delisted between rebalancing periods were\\nexcluded from the sample. This was in order to\\nintegrate favorable ESG ratings improvements\\nwithin an equally-weighted portfolio using an\\nMSCI ESG ratings time series. Quarterly returns\\nwere computed for each portfolio from January\\n2007 to January 2017, for the purposes of mea-\\nsuring the effect of integrating ESG ratings into\\ninvestment strategies. This test was run for three\\nseparate iterations, each beginning in 2007 with a\\ndifferent randomly selected portfolio of 30 stocks.\\nThough the selection of ﬁrms within the three\\nESG portfolios was at ﬁrst random, and then\\nsolely based on quarterly increase in ESG score,\\neach of the portfolios maintained a sector weight-\\ning with a 71.09% correlation, as measured by\\nthe Pearson product–moment correlation coefﬁ-\\ncient, with the sector weightings of the MSCI\\nWorld Index. This indicates a ﬁnding similar to\\nthat discussed in by Benjamin Auer (2016) in\\nhis study “Do Socially Responsible Investment\\nPolicies Add or Destroy European Stock Port-\\nfolio Valuation”, in which he ﬁnds that using\\nnegative screens to construct Socially Responsi-\\nble Investing portfolios does not appear to change\\nthe representative industry weights of portfo-\\nlios when compared with the sector weightings\\nof existing portfolios.22 These portfolios were\\nfurther tested using a two-tailed paired t-test, and\\nthe Sharpe ratio in order to test not only the\\nreturns generated by the portfolios, but also the\\nrisk-adjusted return potential for ESG-integrated\\nportfolios. The Sharpe ratio was calculated as\\n¯\\nrp−rf\\nσp , where ¯\\nrp represents the expected return of\\nthe portfolio, rf represents the risk-free rate (in\\nthis case, the returns provided by the randomly\\nselected portfolio benchmark), and σp represents\\nthe cumulative standard deviation of the excess\\nreturns of the portfolio. The risk-free rate used to\\ncalculate the Sharpe ratio was assumed to be the\\nquarterly returns yielded by the benchmark port-\\nfolio, as this would provide the clearest evidence\\nof the impact of ESG-integration on the Sharpe\\nratio of the ESG portfolios.\\n3.4 Assumptions and limitations\\nThis study exclusively employed MSCI ratings in\\norder to present consistent methodology for the\\npurposes of building sample portfolios.

Therefore, this study acknowledges\\nitself to be limited to only the companies rated by\\nMSCI Inc. between 2007 and 2017. This study\\nis also limited by the relative recentness of ESG,\\nand the limited amount of publicly available data\\nfor measuring its quantitative impact. As MSCI\\nonly began rating companies in 2007, this study\\nis limited to 10 years of data.

Market risk\\npremium, the differential between the market\\nyield and the risk-free rate, size risk premium,\\nthe differential between the returns of large and\\nsmall companies, value risk premium, the dif-\\nferential between high and low book-to-market\\nratios, proﬁtability risk premium, the differ-\\nential between the returns of companies with\\nrobust operating proﬁtability and weak prof-\\nitability ratios, and investment proﬁtability, the\\ndifferential between conservative and aggres-\\nsive investment strategies have all been proven\\nto provide higher excess returns across geogra-\\nphies and time periods. Liquidity risk premium,\\nfound within the differential between the price\\nand yields of liquid and illiquid bond invest-\\nments, has likewise been proven to provide excess\\nreturns. This study likewise has demonstrated\\nthat ESG risk premium, the difference in returns\\nbetween strategies which integrate ESG factors\\nandstrategieswhichignorethesefactors, hasbeen\\nshown to positively affect ﬁnancial returns across\\ngeographies and time periods.\\nBeyond the statistically signiﬁcant data on ESG-\\nintegration as a factor of risk premia, the impli-\\ncations of this study on both the academic and\\ninvestment communities are signiﬁcant. Not only\\ndoes this research lay the foundation for future\\nacademic study and practice of investing, but also\\nthe results of the study imply the ESG factors\\nand principles provide insight into the ﬁnan-\\ncial performance of a company. Furthermore,\\ncompanies might consider becoming ESG-aware\\nand incorporate ESG issues and techniques into\\ntheir organizational structures, business models,\\npolicies, and initiatives.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nThis study has demonstrated ﬁrst the characteris-\\ntics needed to establish the existence of indepen-\\ndent risk premia (namely the existence of geo-\\ngraphic and longitudinal evidence of increased\\ninsight into the return distribution of an asset\\nby a measurable factor), and secondly evidence\\nthat ESG factors, as measured by independent\\nrating agencies, ﬁt the characteristics of inde-\\npendent risk premia. In doing so, it has laid the\\nfoundation for future statistically signiﬁcant data\\nanalysis establishing ESG factors as providers of\\nindependent and measurable risk premia. It has\\nbuilt upon previous academic literature, such as\\nBansal et al.’s (2016) study, “Socially Respon-\\nsible Investing: Good Is Good, Bad Is Bad”,\\nand others who empirically ﬁnd that changes\\nin socially responsibility ratings have a statis-\\ntically signiﬁcant effect on cumulative returns.\\nFuture studies on this topic may demonstrate\\nthat ESG factors can be quantiﬁably integrated\\ninto investment strategies in much the same way\\nas other risk premia to generate alpha. Recom-\\nmended future studies might include the study\\nof ESG as a blended risk premium within a\\nmulti-factor model. These future studies may also\\nﬁnd it advantageous to investigate the implica-\\ntions of ESG-integration within speciﬁc regions,\\nwithin speciﬁc industries, and within asset classes\\nbeyond just equities. Cross-sectional ESG data\\nprovided by independent rating agencies such as\\nMSCI Inc. is increasingly establishing ESG as not\\nonly a valid indicator of a company’s long-term\\nhealth, but also a source of insight into the prob-\\nability distribution of returns. Such a conclusion\\nextends the purpose of ESG factors beyond pol-\\nicy and corporate social responsibility, instating it\\ninstead as risk premia comparable to those estab-\\nlished by Fama and French, and built upon by\\nPástor and Stambaugh, Cathcart, and others.\\nAcknowledgment\\nWe thank our colleagues from MSCI Inc. who\\nprovided access to ESG ratings from 2007 to 2017\\nwhich greatly assisted the research presented in\\nthis study.
